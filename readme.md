# Segments: Grow | Learn | Build | Play

A structured method of sharing centered around 4 segments: Born from the desire the engage with social mediums intentionally while learning & sharing to nourish neuroplasticity.

Segments has become a guide to a weekly practice of sharing that weaves nourishing neuroplasticity with intentional sharing. Four days of the week are dedicated to sharing intentionally in the context of each of the four segments.

As each month comes to an end, I'll share two documentation pieces as part of my commitment to sharing Segments as a process:

1. The **Build** segment Show&Tell
- A framework comprised of metrics to guide multi-applicable 4 week builds. I'll share the metrics weekly & by the end of the month, it'll be a Show&Tell. 
- 
2. Month-long roundup documentation 
- A roundup documentation piece that captures all shares from each month. The roundup will include the links, reads, listens, etc. as a reference point.
